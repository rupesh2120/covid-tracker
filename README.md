# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Deployed app link

### How this project made?

Here I have created an App using ReactJS where I used an API which takes data and shows the statistic view of covid-19 cases all over the world. I have used covid data api to implement this app. The api provides different type of datas related to affected, recovered and death based on the country we select. https://covid19.mathdro.id/api
, this is the api link which I used in my app.


### What this project does?

When we run this app, it will first hit the api which has global data. This is because we have written the axios method in the componentDidMount() function. So whenever our app will load, componentDidMount() will also load. I have used dropdown which has list of different countries.
